    <!-- Rules of the Game -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Governed by the International Tennis Federation (ITF), tennis follows a unique scoring and match format:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Points go 15 → 30 → 40 → Game. If tied at 40, it’s called "Deuce". Players must win by two consecutive points.</li>
        <li><strong>Sets & Matches:</strong> A match is best of 3 or 5 sets. A player must win 6 games to win a set, with at least 2-game lead.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve:</strong> The server must hit diagonally into the opponent’s service box. Two chances are allowed per serve.</li>
        <li><strong>Let:</strong> A serve that hits the net and lands in the correct service box is replayed.</li>
        <li><strong>Fault:</strong> If the serve misses the service box twice, it's a double fault and point goes to opponent.</li>
        <li><strong>Ball In/Out:</strong> A ball that lands outside the boundary lines is "Out". Line calls are crucial in professional matches.</li>
        <li><strong>Volleying:</strong> Allowed, but not before the ball crosses the net unless done after a bounce on own side.</li>
        <li><strong>Tiebreaker:</strong> Used when score reaches 6–6 in a set (7-point format in most tournaments).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tennis emphasizes fair play, etiquette, and sportsmanship. Quiet during points, shaking hands after matches, and respect for line calls are part of tennis culture.
