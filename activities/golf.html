    <!-- Rules of the Game -->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Golf is governed by The R&A and the USGA. Its rules emphasize honesty, respect, and precision:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Objective:</strong> Complete the course in as few strokes as possible. The player with the lowest score wins.</li>
        <li><strong>Scoring:</strong> Strokes are counted per hole. Scoring terms include Birdie (1 under par), Eagle (2 under), Bogey (1 over), etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Teeing Off:</strong> Players must tee off within the designated area. Order of play follows honor system or lowest previous score.</li>
        <li><strong>Ball Play:</strong> Must be played as it lies—no movement unless under specific relief rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Penalties:</strong> Strokes are added for lost balls, unplayable lies, hitting into water or out of bounds.</li>
        <li><strong>Putting:</strong> Occurs on the green using a putter. The ball must be holed completely.</li>
        <li><strong>Etiquette:</strong> Players should not distract others, repair divots, and maintain pace of play.</li>
        <li><strong>Handicaps:</strong> Allow players of varying skill levels to compete fairly based on average scores.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Golf teaches integrity and patience. It's one of the few sports where players self-regulate and record their own scores.
