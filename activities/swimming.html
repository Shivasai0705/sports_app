    <section class="section">
      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Competitive swimming is governed by FINA (Fédération Internationale de Natation). Key rules include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Strokes:</strong> Freestyle, Backstroke, Breaststroke, and Butterfly. Each has specific techniques and regulations.</li>
        <li><strong>Start:</strong> Swimmers begin with a dive (except backstroke), and false starts lead to disqualification.</li>
        <li><strong>Turns:</strong> Flip turns (freestyle/backstroke) or open turns (breaststroke/butterfly) must follow stroke-specific rules.</li>
        <li><strong>Finishing:</strong> Touching the wall is mandatory with one or both hands depending on the stroke.</li>
        <li><strong>Relay Exchanges:</strong> The next swimmer must start after the previous swimmer touches the wall.</li>
        <li><strong>Disqualification:</strong> Occurs due to early starts, incorrect turns, illegal strokes, or missing wall touches.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sportsmanship, lane etiquette, and safety are key in swimming. Respect for officials and fellow swimmers is essential at all levels of competition.
