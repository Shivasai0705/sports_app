    <!-- Rules of the Game -->
    <section class="section">
        <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
        <p>
          Cricket is played between two teams of 11 players. Each match is split into innings where teams alternate between batting and fielding. The format (Test, ODI, or T20) determines match duration and strategy. Below are the key rules applicable across formats:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Innings:</strong> Each team gets one or two innings depending on the format. The goal is to score more runs than the opposing team.</li>
          <li><strong>Overs:</strong> A bowler delivers 6 balls per over. Limited-overs matches have a set number of overs (20 or 50).</li>
          <li><strong>Scoring Runs:</strong> Runs are scored when batsmen run between wickets or hit the ball to the boundary (4 runs if grounded, 6 if airborne).</li>
          <li><strong>Dismissals:</strong> Ways a batsman can be out include:
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Bowled:</strong> Ball hits the stumps.</li>
              <li><strong>Caught:</strong> Fielder catches ball before it touches the ground.</li>
              <li><strong>LBW (Leg Before Wicket):</strong> Ball hits batter's pad in front of stumps without hitting the bat.</li>
              <li><strong>Run Out:</strong> Fielder breaks the stumps before batter completes a run.</li>
              <li><strong>Stumped:</strong> Wicketkeeper removes the bails when batter is outside the crease and not attempting a run.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><strong>Field Restrictions:</strong> Limited-overs cricket uses powerplays to limit number of fielders outside a 30-yard circle in early overs.</li>
          <li><strong>Bowling Restrictions:</strong> No bowler can bowl more than a certain number of overs (e.g., 4 in T20, 10 in ODI).</li>
          <li><strong>No-Balls & Wides:</strong> Illegal deliveries result in extra runs and an extra ball. Some no-balls result in a free hit.</li>
          <li><strong>Umpires:</strong> Two on-field umpires and one TV (third) umpire oversee decision-making. DRS may be used in professional games.</li>
          <li><strong>Winning Criteria:</strong> Team with the most runs at the end of the match wins. In Test cricket, a team can win by innings or runs if the opposing team fails to surpass the target in both innings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Cricket promotes fair play, and players are expected to follow the "Spirit of Cricket," emphasizing respect for opponents and umpires.</p>
