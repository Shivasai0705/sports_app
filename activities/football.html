      <h2>Rules of the Game</h2>
      <p>
        Governed by FIFA (Fédération Internationale de Football Association), football rules ensure fair play and safety. Here are the major ones:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A match is played over <strong>90 minutes</strong>, split into two halves of 45 minutes with a 15-minute halftime.</li>
        <li>Each team has <strong>11 players</strong> on the field, including a goalkeeper.</li>
        <li>Goals are scored by getting the ball into the opposing net without using hands or arms.</li>
        <li>Only goalkeepers may use hands — and only within their own penalty area.</li>
        <li><strong>Offside Rule:</strong> Prevents attackers from staying too close to the goal when receiving the ball.</li>
        <li><strong>Fouls:</strong> Illegal physical contact like tripping, pushing, or handball results in free kicks or penalties.</li>
        <li><strong>Yellow and Red Cards:</strong> Used for warnings or expulsions. Two yellows = red card → ejection.</li>
        <li>Games may have <strong>extra time</strong> and <strong>penalty shootouts</strong> in knockouts.</li>
      </ul>
